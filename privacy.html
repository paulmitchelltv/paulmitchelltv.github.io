in the normal course of our business, to allow us to register you to receive our services and to provide you with our services;
to allow us to analyse your personal preferences and personalise our website to you;

We will only use your personal data where we are permitted to do so by law and where:

we need to use your personal data to enter into an employment contract with you;
we need to use your personal data to comply with our legal obligations;

<h2>Transfers of personal data outwith the UK</h2>

the transfer is to a country which the EU Commission has decided ensures an adequate level of protection for your personal data; or
we have put in place our own measures to ensure adequate security as required by data protection law. These measures include ensuring that your personal data is kept safe by carrying out strict security checks on our overseas partners and suppliers, backed by strong contractual undertakings approved by the relevant regulators such as the EU style model clauses. Some US providers may also be certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield which confirms they have appropriate measures in place to ensure the protection of your personal data.

<h2>Retention of personal data</h2>
We will only keep your personal data for as long as it is needed for each of the purposes we have identified above. Usually, we will retain your information for the duration of your relationship with us unless we are required by law to retain your personal data for a longer period.
